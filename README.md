# Swift Scan
Swift Scan is an [Android](https://developer.android.com/studio) application that scans any barcode using your mobile device and keeps an inventory of your collections. Also enables the option to manually add items to the inventory. Must have [Barcode Scanner](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.zxing.client.android&hl=en_US) to use.

Most RFID reader kits are complicated and hard to use. This product is being developed to provide RFID reader capabilities to the common user. We want to allow collectors and small businesses to easily keep track of their items. In addition, we'd like to partner with different companies to allow their customers to easily obtain information about their products.
